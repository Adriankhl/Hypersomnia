render order:

1. Legs, 1 animation for walking, 1 for running (optional)
2. Arms, SPRITE for bare handed walking and animation for hitting, and possibly SPRITE for every kind of weapon for holding
3. Torso, multiple animations per item instance: (walking + shooting for one for every kind of weapon: bare hands, melee, rifle, sniper)
4. Head, one SPRITE per item instance, also for running.

The above is customizable.



When the packet with a new position arrives to the server, 
it should calculate a force vector (or velocity vector) to be applied to the character so that in the next simulation step it reaches the requested position.
