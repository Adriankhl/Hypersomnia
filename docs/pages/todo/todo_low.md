#separate guids from the cosmos, they are rarely needed
consider if entities without guids are at all addressed by guids;
in any case, we can always iterate if we do not find an entry within the map,
and the guids will nicely fit into the inferred cache scheme. 

#has/find templates should fail for fundamental components
#We might leave the find so that we can conveniently switch between a component being fundamental or not.
#Has is anyway a bad pattern.

rename world, cosmos to csm
