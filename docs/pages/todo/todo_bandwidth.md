summary: Things to do to improve bandwidth.

- Clear cosmic entropy when the player is not conscious
	- So that others are not allowed to waste bandwidth when they are dead

- Let user send its mouse sensitivity and later only send shorts to better encode the mouse movement

- Don't send the same entropy to the client who sent it, if it was unmodified
	- Make a bit for that
