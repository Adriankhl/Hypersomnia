summary: That which we are brainstorming at the moment.
---

- Animation architecture
	- Animation asset
		- Several distinct types of animations
			- Each animation will be treated as a completely different asset
				- Then we will never std::visit contextually, because we will always contextually know what kind of animation we are after
				- Mass selection just like anything else
				- Just the editor's window for animations will just hold all types separated
			- Might be a little pain in the ass to setup
			- Actual types
				- Plain animation
					- Just list of frames w/durations
					- Suitable for decorations or for particles
				- Animation for the gun being shot
					- Can actually be a plain animation, can't it?
					- The sprite chosen for the gun will be the gun in its idle state
					- Later maybe an animation for being idle?
						- Gun would hold both ids
						- Rendering routine could just see if these ids are set
				- General: Torso animation
					- Will only have base speed ms, as game will determine pacing for each frame
					- Frame state: 
						- torso metrics
							- vec2i hand position[2]
							- positions of these could be even indicated in the previewed image
				- Shooting torso animation
					- Can have duration per frame, no problem
					- Frame state: 
						- torso metrics
							- vec2i hand position[2]
							- positions of these could be even indicated in the previewed image
				- Moving legs animation
					- Will only have base speed ms, as game will determine pacing for each frame
					- Frame state
						- We won't implement these just yet. Won't matter until after deathmatch stage
						- leg metrics
							- value_with_flag<vec2i> foot_position[2]
						- is step, or just assume that the last frame denotes a step
					- Then the sentience invariant specifies particle effect to play on step
						- Or the common state holds a map of ground material types to step sounds
							- This could be an asset as well
				- Implementation
					- We shall begin with movement animation and then repeat the code for the rest of types?
		- Identification in editor
			- Architecturally, animation is an unpathed asset
			- Visibly, it is always tied to some path designating the first animation frame
				- Screw that. Animation will have enough state to warrant just picking what is created already.
			- Do we open a path dialog when choosing an animation?
				- No.
			- Displayed name is immutable either way - always the name of the first frame.
				- We don't care for now that displayed names can be duplicated.
		- An animation frame of any type will guarantee only the image id to exist
		- Animation asset state may be in this case important for game state
			- E.g. hand metrics could determine swing trajectories
			- E.g. foot metrics could determine sound events
			- Thus we make animations logical assets
				- Nothing wrong with it, is there?
					- It will anyway stay immutable. The only practical difference is in which code can access what.
					- Later, we might introduce mutable states for these animations as well, and they will act like flavours
						- Though it will be discouraged for the sake of statelessness
	- In solvable
		- Each torso specifies a set of animations that it uses
			- Torso invariant
				- forward legs animation id
				- strafing legs animation id (later)
				- walk animation id
				- punch animation id (later)
				- rifle carry animation id
					- No problem with hand offset being rotated a little.
				- rifle shoot animation id
				- pistol carry animation id
				- pistol shoot animation id
				- akimbo carry animation id
					- Will be same both for pistols and rifles
				- akimbo shoot - only a half
					- after shot animation is complete, we should return to akimbo carry animation with 0 offset
			- Character flavour will have its own torso invariant, which would denote the basic armour - when nothing else is worn
				- The animations shall depend on the torso invariant of the item in the armour slot
			- draw_entity finds the relevant armour invariant
		- Movement component shall expose "movement amount" from whose the torso frame number will be calculated statelessly
	- Interaction with item attachment offsets
		- item invariant should specify hand offset, which will determine relative positioning to the hand

- Particles and flavours
	- std::unordered_map<particle_flavour_id, vector of particles>
		- We will always simulate all particles that we have in memory.
		- This will add a nice speedup, and also we will easily invalidate particles when particle flavour changes or is deleted.
		- Particle types will also be pooled and will be a separate viewable.

- Fix what happens when too many entities are created
	- **Let the game work when a new entity cannot be created.**
		- Just return a dead handle.

- Probably somehow disallow arbitrary inferring of relational cache?
	- There was some unresolved crash problem with this.

- Persistence of entity ids in editor and clearing them
	- Cases of storage:
		- Selection
			- Rectangular
			- Significant
		- Groups
	- Cases of invalidation:
		- **Undoing a command that introduces new entities**
			- E.g. one that creates an entity from nothing
			- Look for both undo_last_create and "delete_entity"
		- Commands whose undoing or redoing should automatically select affected entities
			- Purge is justified in this case
			- shouldn't this be pretty much all commands that affect entity existence?
				- No. Redoing delete has no reason to purge selections of some other entities.
					- Clear individually, also for the groups.
			- problem: if, on delete, we remove an entity from the group it belongs to, the undoing of delete doesn't know what to do
				- grouping will be tracked by history
				- thus let the delete command just store its own "ungroup entities" command and invoke it beforehand on all entries
		- Delete command
		- Gameplay mode
			- For now we won't support editor operations inside gameplay mode?
				- Should be easy enough though, we can always just read the deletion commands
			- To ensure space efficiency even with static allocations, we'll just serialize the cosmos to bytes instead of making a full clone
				- Should even be faster considering that recreating some associative containers' structure might be already costly
	- mover should be deactivated when?
		- corner case: delete while move?
		- should work anyway and yeah, deactivate it then

- Grenades shall change shape to circle so that throws can be precise
	- Let hand fuse invariant have an optional radius for the thrown grenade
		- should we reinfer when tweaking?
	- the physics world cache will simply take into consideration if the hand fuse was released, when calculating shape
		- so hand fuse component might want to become a synchronizable

- game mode property is a part of game mode definition
- game mode definition = all game mode properties
- a **game mode marker** is a game mode property of game mode definition that has a spatial representation
	- and thus can be visualized in the world view
	- e.g. C4 trigger or a spawn point

- It makes little sense for an intercosm to have a built-in collection of game mode definitions...
	- ...at least on the grounds that there will be less files overall.
	- because we will anyway have lots of stuff under gfx/ and sfx/
	- and it introduces some stupid corner cases, right?
- so, most of our headache comes from the fact that we have hard time drawing the fine line responsibilities of...
	- ...what is necessary to define in the map itself, e.g. spawn points or flavours
	- ...what should be configurable per every session of a game mode, e.g. roundtime.
	- this dichotomy, once voiced, pretty much speaks for itself.
	- basically, if some game mode properties need to be defined in relation to what is in the map, 
		- then yes, have it in the definition file and configurable in the editor.
		- still can be changed and customized, just saying we'll make UI for this in editor and save/load ops.
	- things like round time, c4 time, they can be specified completely regardless of the intercosm contents.
		- thus they should be textual configs, for which we can nevertheless provide some GUIs.

- Each game mode definition file will be named after its stem, and the extension will determine its type
	- **(Implemented first)** struct team_deathmatch
		- (Implemented first) player flavour id
		- (Implemented first) vector of spawn transforms
		- std optional with preferred duel transforms
	- struct free_for_all
		- player flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
	- struct bomb_defuse
		- player flavour id
		- c4 flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
		- vector of xywh rects signifying bombsites
	- struct capture_the_flag
		- player flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
		- flag flavour id
		- flag base flavour id
		- flag positions
	- struct mmo_server
		- start player flavour 
- special-purpose logic for markers vs entities
	- it might anyway later come in handy to visualize rects and points
	- so we might just as well reuse that logic for markers
- server will accept an ``std::variant<free_for_all, bomb_defuse...>``
	- each will perform its own logic
- a hotkey should toggle visibility of **game mode markers**

- Interoperation of cosmos logic and data defined in game mode properties
- Construction scripts are a different thing and we'll save scripting topics and their determinism for later

- file operations:
	- new project
		- opens new tab and spawns a folder in untitleds directory
	- open folder
		- opens a folder, loads whatever there is
	- save project as
		- choose existing directory
			- ranger can do that 
	- save project
		- if untitled, uses save as instead
		- same as Ctrl+S.
		- writes all visible project files: intercosm and all rulesets visible to the editor. Purges autosave once done.
		- if saving for the first time to a directory, editor may ask
			- Are you sure you want to overwrite 3 file(s)
				/home/pbc/x.int
				/home/pbc/x.hyproj
				/home/pbc/autosave/x.int
			?	
			- (non-existent files and files with 0 size will be excluded)
			- a different popup design will be in order
				- after receiveing dialog's future result, set an optional pending save object
					- thus we constrain asynchronicity as much as possible and escape it as quickly as possible
				- those that have only "okay" can stay as they are
	- (save for later) import intercosm (either lua or int)
		- Will just assign the new intercosm to the one in current project. 
		- We can "only" open projects, thus it is named "import".
		- Will rarely be used, usually just for porting or if someone wants to modify an intercosm downloaded from somewhere.
			- We could transmit projects though.
	- (save for later) Export project for compatibility
		- In lua format only.
		- Will be named like ``ProjectName.compat.lua``
			- Contains the intercosm and rulesets, all important things.

- check in editor if the saving/opening path is a valid folder?
- make reveal in explorer work for both files and folders
	- cause it also works for dirs
