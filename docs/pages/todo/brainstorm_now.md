summary: That which we are brainstorming at the moment.
---

- Game events log and chat
	- In the same window
	- ImGui or own GUI?
		- We actually have some textbox code we can introduce later for chatting
			- Better control over such an important feature

- let players spawn for a moment after beginning the round
	- though not after changing a team

- Remove the notion of container_with_small_size
	- Interesting concept but we'll just handle it during actual serialization stage

- Structuring entropy
	- What a client sends to the server?
		- Necessarily, the contents of mode_player_entropy
		- The cosmic entropy generated by the main
			- The server validates it
			- There really ain't no difference between if the player attaches its entity id or the mode player id
			- In fact it can attach none at all since the server can associate it
			- So it can be further compressed during serialization pass.
	- What a server sends to the client?
		- The single, entire, summed up mode_entropy
	- Contribution of main to the entropy
		- Should main know about the mode entropy at all?
			- Argument against: Indeed, main wouldn't really post any mode entropy as the logic is concerned purely with cosmic content.
				- Main shall only generate cosmic entropy
				- Also, main only ever posts intents with regards to a single controlled entity.
				- Some remapping will be needed.
			- Perhaps not. It should only be concerned with sending inputs to entities according to the id already controlled.
	- Per entropic player id, all vectors of commands
		- Chosen strategy
		- Optionals instead of vectors for one-shots, e.g. team choices
			- But we don't have to differentiate for now
		- Zero-commands will be signified by a zero bit

- Revival and undoing the knockouts

- Reloading
	- Essential to gameplay, really, so best to do it early
	- Do we implement entire mounting system? Maybe it won't be so hard after all
	- Also, cocking the gun
		- Should have a separate sound in gun invariant
		- Should always happen automatically when one hand is free and the other holds the gun
			- Is an exception to the rule of mounting that both items need to be in hand
			- For now, can play the shooting animation for cocking

- Dashing
	- Assigned to space, since we don't have jumping anyway
	- pure color highlight system could be used to add highlight the dashing entity
	- Gradually increase walking force over time
	- The more the speed during dash, the stronger the dash

- add a match-global rng seed offset to mode state

- GUI required by modes
	- Arena GUI
		- Used by bomb modes, TDM modes etc.
			- May use some if constexprs internally
		- It's not synchronized, nor is it performance critical...
			- ...so let's screw that strong typing and have just one arena_gui type
		- Elements
			- Round time
				- Read only
			- Recent kills
				- Read only
			- TAB menu
				- State: bool show
				- Interactive
			- Team selection
				- State: bool show
				- Interactive
			- General
				- Read-onlies are drawn with our own GUI, from within draw_custom_gui of each setup concerned

- Delta controls for property editor
	- Will be useful for offsets
	- New tweaker_type?
		- Based on this, set is_delta boolean in change_property_command
		- can_accumulate_v trait

- Player & modes
	- A mode shall operate without crash on virtually any cosmos
		- Should catch up with changes
	- A player stores initial signi. It updates it every time:
		- A scene is filled.
		- A special button is pressed.
	- For resetting a round, the modes will need to have an initial comos solvable
		- For round-less modes, e.g. test scene mode, we can simply pass the same cosmos
			- Actually just have a constexpr bool for each
		- To re-create characters, we'll need to keep track of all of them
			- Better than to transfer from the existing cosmos as it will make it deterministic
			- Plus we'll be able to delete dead player entities if for some reason we need it
	- Keeping track of character-client relation after round is reset?
		- Server keeps client-entity_guid pairs?
			- How do we make that entity_guid invariant?
			- Perhaps we should choose a unique in-game name for each and use it as an id?
				- components::text_details
					- instance name
					- actually a map would be better as it will be a frequent use case and we shouldn't add this to all entities
					- clients will simply query the map to find the viewing character

- Mode round ecology
	- Example procedure:
		- Server starts with no players, the mode gets initialized and just advances.
			- Special win condition logic for when there are no players.
		- Somebody connects mid-round.
			- They have to choose a faction, if so the server allows.
				- Should this also be mode logic?
				- We might later introduce auto-balance, in which case it might be good for it to stay deterministic.
			- Changing of faction shall be part of mode entropy.
			- Mode could keep track of names to be spawned.
			- Simply add_player({ ... }, nickname) on connection.
				- This first makes them a spectator.

- Mode vars gui
	- Can set the current one, resetting the cosmos

- Storage of pre-defined mode informations inside a map
	- ``.modes`` file
		- A map is still functional without modes and modes can always be later specified, so a separate file is justified
		- As flavour ids aren't human readable, makes sense to use binary format for now
	- Each should also have a name, e.g. "test scene", "bomb", "ffa", "tdm", "duel"
		- For easy choosing from the admin console
	- unordered map of ints for each defined profile
		- player stores the current int and a variant of mode instances
		- we std::visit by the mode instance on advancing and then acquire the vars by it
	- Editor view shall keep track of current mode instance?
		- We thought about the player, but we must serialize this per-opened folder.
		- Editor view is suitable because:
			- It is the part of the state that is specific to the editor session, but will never be used during gameplay.
			- This actually implies that the **player should be found within the view**.
			- No problem having player state per-view, just that we'll pause it whenever we switch a tab or quit the editor.
		- What about history of changes made during the mode?
		- Probably player as well.
		- The work won't store any 

- However it is to the discretion of a mode *how* the creation and removal of players happen...
	- ...it is already outside of their scope *when* they happen.
	- Therefore, each mode shall expose add_player and remove_player functions to be called by literally anybody, anytime.
		- As for serialization, these will be some "choreographic events" inserted between steps, or in a case of a network session, "network event"
	- Similarly, change_var shall not be something that the mode bothers with, especially that the calling logic would be pretty much duplicated.
	- There will still be much use of the messages; e.g. mode_messages::game_completed to determine the result

- Mode entropy 
	- As it steps together with the cosmos, will necessarily contain cosmic entropy
	- Mode messages:
		- mode_messages::add_player	
			- For FFA, we just ignore the associated faction
		- mode_messages::remove_player	
		- mode_messages::change_property
			- e.g. for changing round times on the fly
			- could be implemented similarly to editor properties
				- especially since we'll create a property editor for the game mode properties
		- mode_messages::create_entity
			- For admin playing
		- mode_messages::apply_impulse
			- For admin playing

- "I" in editor invokes initialization routine of the chosen game mode
	- Just starts advancing it from the beginning.

- team & ffa matches should get different logic altogether

- FFA game mode
	- Win condition: None, there is only time limit.
- Duel game mode
	- Win condition: same as TDM, just will be less players
	- Just different kinds of spawns
	- **Actually, we won't create special purpose logic for duels.**
		- There will just be specific maps for playing TDM as duel.
- Team deathmatch game mode
	- Win condition: Consciousness status of any entity of CT side
- Bomb defuse game mode
	- Win condition: Existence of any entity of C4 flavour
		- A bomb can only stop existing due to being detonated
	- Win condition: Consciousness status of any entity of CT side

- Game modes shall be separated into immutable & instance
	- The instance will probably have a mutable copy of the immutable, anyway, for admin tweaks

- Map won't define that "a weapon can't be bought here".
	- It will only provide a list of ready-to-be-used profiles where this could be specified.

- To avoid transmitting some server-decided seed for the beginning of each round (e.g. to position players around)...
	- ...we can just derive a hash of all inputs from the previous round, or just hash entire cosmos state
	- this way we are unpredictable about it but still deterministic

- Game-mode profiles
	- Each map can specify a "profile" with sensible values for a deathmatch, tdm, etc.
		- At the same time, it will be documenting the proper use of the map
	- Will be useful for a built-in test scene
			
- game mode property is a part of game mode definition
- game mode definition = all game mode properties
- a **game mode marker** is a game mode property of game mode definition that has a spatial representation
	- and thus can be visualized in the world view
	- e.g. C4 trigger or a spawn point

- It makes little sense for an intercosm to have a built-in collection of game mode definitions...
	- ...at least on the grounds that there will be less files overall.
	- because we will anyway have lots of stuff under gfx/ and sfx/
	- and it introduces some stupid corner cases, right?
- so, most of our headache comes from the fact that we have hard time drawing the fine line responsibilities of...
	- ...what is necessary to define in the map itself, e.g. spawn points or flavours
	- ...what should be configurable per every session of a game mode, e.g. roundtime.
	- this dichotomy, once voiced, pretty much speaks for itself.
	- basically, if some game mode properties need to be defined in relation to what is in the map, 
		- then yes, have it in the definition file and configurable in the editor.
		- still can be changed and customized, just saying we'll make UI for this in editor and save/load ops.
	- things like round time, c4 time, they can be specified completely regardless of the intercosm contents.
		- thus they should be textual configs, for which we can nevertheless provide some GUIs.

- Each game mode definition file will be named after its stem, and the extension will determine its type
	- **(Implemented first)** struct team_deathmatch
		- (Implemented first) player flavour id
		- (Implemented first) vector of spawn transforms
		- std optional with preferred duel transforms
	- struct free_for_all
		- player flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
	- struct bomb_defuse
		- player flavour id
		- c4 flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
		- vector of xywh rects signifying bombsites
	- struct capture_the_flag
		- player flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
		- flag flavour id
		- flag base flavour id
		- flag positions
	- struct mmo_server
		- start player flavour 
- server will accept an ``std::variant<free_for_all, bomb_defuse...>``
	- each will perform its own logic

- Construction scripts are a different thing and we'll save scripting topics and their determinism for later

- file operations:
	- new project
		- opens new tab and spawns a folder in untitleds directory
	- open folder
		- opens a folder, loads whatever there is
	- save project as
		- choose existing directory
			- ranger can do that 
	- save project
		- if untitled, uses save as instead
		- same as Ctrl+S.
		- writes all visible project files: intercosm and all rulesets visible to the editor. Purges autosave once done.
		- if saving for the first time to a directory, editor may ask
			- Are you sure you want to overwrite 3 file(s)
				/home/pbc/x.int
				/home/pbc/x.hyproj
				/home/pbc/autosave/x.int
			?	
			- (non-existent files and files with 0 size will be excluded)
			- a different popup design will be in order
				- after receiveing dialog's future result, set an optional pending save object
					- thus we constrain asynchronicity as much as possible and escape it as quickly as possible
				- those that have only "okay" can stay as they are
	- (save for later) import intercosm (either lua or int)
		- Will just assign the new intercosm to the one in current project. 
		- We can "only" open projects, thus it is named "import".
		- Will rarely be used, usually just for porting or if someone wants to modify an intercosm downloaded from somewhere.
			- We could transmit projects though.
	- (save for later) Export project for compatibility
		- In lua format only.
		- Will be named like ``ProjectName.compat.lua``
			- Contains the intercosm and rulesets, all important things.

- Transform design
	- It is the case that many entities might share identical origin, in which case it would be unwieldy to update origins for all entities to a new one.
		- E.g. fish in aquarium.
	- It is also the case that the origins might be tied to decorational entities.
		- E.g. aquarium sand.
	- movement path component will have an origin transform which will automatically be moved by the editor
		- the transform component will be kept up to date and it will be the logical transform
		- the rendering code will also only touch this logical transform
	- for editor, the origin could just also be accessed as an independent transform
		- so access_independent_transform -> access_independent_transforms
		- con: more memory wasted? who gives a heck, though...

- Sound should be loaded from the smallest to the biggest
	- So that effects are loaded first
	- New synchronization
		- store std::atomic<bool> next to sound_buffer in loaded_sounds_map
			- set it to false whenever definition changes or it is to be loaded
			- check if future is implemented same way

- find closest point pairs for fish?
	- firstly determine if the setting of the new npo node isn't actually the bottleneck
	- tho probably it's the false positives

- Note: drone sound (sentience sounds overall) will be calculated exactly as the firing engine sound
	- Sentience humming caches
	- These don't need their playing pos synchronized

- Property editor: Checkbox matrix for b2Filter
	- might be useful once we come to glass walls 
	- a list of predefined filters
		- might choose a name, just like enums
		- stored in common assets
	- now sensible filters values will be provided by the testbed

- Shuffled animations
	- Inside randomizing system?

- Particles and flavours
	- std::unordered_map<particle_flavour_id, vector of particles>
		- We will always simulate all particles that we have in memory.
		- This will add a nice speedup, and also we will easily invalidate particles when particle flavour changes or is deleted.
		- Particle types will also be pooled and will be a separate viewable.

- Fix what happens when too many entities are created
	- **Let the game work when a new entity cannot be created.**
		- Just return a dead handle.

- Probably somehow disallow arbitrary inferring of relational cache?
	- There was some unresolved crash problem with this.

- Persistence of entity ids in editor and clearing them
	- Cases of storage:
		- Selection
			- Rectangular
			- Significant
		- Groups
	- Cases of invalidation:
		- **Undoing a command that introduces new entities**
			- E.g. one that creates an entity from nothing
			- Look for both undo_last_create and "delete_entity"
		- Commands whose undoing or redoing should automatically select affected entities
			- Purge is justified in this case
			- shouldn't this be pretty much all commands that affect entity existence?
				- No. Redoing delete has no reason to purge selections of some other entities.
					- Clear individually, also for the groups.
			- problem: if, on delete, we remove an entity from the group it belongs to, the undoing of delete doesn't know what to do
				- grouping will be tracked by history
				- thus let the delete command just store its own "ungroup entities" command and invoke it beforehand on all entries
		- Delete command
		- Gameplay mode
			- For now we won't support editor operations inside gameplay mode?
				- Should be easy enough though, we can always just read the deletion commands
			- To ensure space efficiency even with static allocations, we'll just serialize the cosmos to bytes instead of making a full clone
				- Should even be faster considering that recreating some associative containers' structure might be already costly
	- mover should be deactivated when?
		- corner case: delete while move?
		- should work anyway and yeah, deactivate it then

- Grenades shall change shape to circle so that throws can be precise
	- Let hand fuse invariant have an optional radius for the thrown grenade
		- should we reinfer when tweaking?
	- the physics world cache will simply take into consideration if the hand fuse was released, when calculating shape
		- so hand fuse component might want to become a synchronizable

- check in editor if the saving/opening path is a valid folder?
- make reveal in explorer work for both files and folders
	- cause it also works for dirs
