summary: That which we are brainstorming at the moment.
---

- adjust doppler factors of bullet trace sounds

- Remember to reset input flags of the character itself on performing transfer

- Easily spawn loaded weapons or magazines
	- For now, let instantiation load them all by default

- Simplify workflow for creating new weapons?
	- E.g. remove the need to specify finishing traces

- Game events log and chat
	- In the same window
	- ImGui or own GUI?
		- We actually have some textbox code we can introduce later for chatting
			- Better control over such an important feature
			
- To avoid transmitting some server-decided seed for the beginning of each round (e.g. to position players around)...
	- ...we can just derive a hash of all inputs from the previous round, or just hash entire cosmos state
	- this way we are unpredictable about it but still deterministic
	- Seed will have to be sent in the beginning anyway, along with the state
	- Some amount of initial information will need to be transmitted anyway
		- Like current players?
		- Isn't this all a matter of sending the bomb mode state?
