summary: That which we are brainstorming at the moment.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- inspect that new crash please before we forget the date

- Emphasize the items laying on the ground
	- Like in hotline miami, they might fly a bit to upper-left direction
	- with a little shadow behind
		- just use existing color overlay shader for that - it will be rendered as the first
	- screw velocity check, just identify the physical filter for it to certainly be the lying item (we don't want to apply it to grenades)
	- a little cyclic shine on the top (might also be done with the overlay shader


- A keyboard map guide
	- hotbar_button_0 -> hotbar 0
	- hotbar_button_1 -> hotbar 1
	- special_action_button_1 -> spell 1
	- maybe just Support spell
		- Offensive spell
		- Defensive spell
	- Then we can rebind B to buy menu

- Left-handed option
- because of the mv really?

- Duplicate the updaters to exe/sfx files without "updater" suffix for old clients to update successfully
- Update existing links on Discord

- Right now "USE_GLFW" is synonymous with building on Mac. Perhaps a better naming is in order?

- Fix those mag refills please
=======
- Look for some filesystem implementation for imgui
	- We'll also replace the system viewers? At least some of them?
		- Only reveal in explorer will be useful at this point

- A setup needs to be able to launch another setup easily
	- A callback with a launcher passed?

- Rock the vote for modes, schemes and difficulties

- We can pay someone to properly re-map all of the official maps in the new editor.
	- The ultimate test.
>>>>>>> 3c333086a... Massive planning progress

- Wtf with those mags appearing at the center of the map?
- Also you can still sometimes get a magazine in hand if you buy HPSR with little inventory space
- And you still sometimes need to reload weapons after the round is restarted

- Player can see the opposing team's inventory post-mortem

- The aborted sounds end abruplty if we have less than 1.0 master/sfx gain in settings

- (Update script) Sync config.lua against the user folder in the home dir, not in hypersomnia dir
	- otherwise we have to call vim_build AND vim_run later

- Post-map-format-fixes
	- match begins in seconds for de_labs2 in bomb_defusal.cpp
	- ultimate wrath of the aeons FX fields are used for electric triad

- Energy consumption fix: sleep the remaining frame time

- Look for imgui demo's Console for a nice copyable log text field
	- separator under button

- Fix flashbang sound volume

- Camera should also ease towards new positions instead of resetting completely

- Fix crash when the read value is a value and lua readwriter expects a table
	- and the other way too
	- just handle an exception probably

- Turn off logs of masterserver and browser later

- Implement sending the current version to the server

- Remember to not send goodbye for when the servers are automatically updating

- Apparently, clipboard prevents connection to any server...
	- Because it can't bind the socket. lol

- The masterserver should dump entire state before restarting for update
	- To give servers a chance, set time of last heartbeat to current time after starting up

- It's not really a problem if the server list is recalculated in the background.
	- The bandwidth used is minimal, especially since we've imposed a limit on the number of packets there.
	- So let the advancer just go all the time.

- later determine why heartbeats mismatch every time

- We should give up on opening hosts that don't respond

- Just pass a lambda for ingame menu which buttons are available
	- Later we'll properly hide them but for now they'll just be inactive

- IPv6 fixes
	- ip-agnostic find_underlying_socket

- advance only advances pings and nats already requested
	- but it is only the imgui-performing function that requests the pings and nats in the first place
		- and only if it detects that there is a need for them and a sufficient interval has passed

- For now, don't save in custom config after connecting from the list

- If someone connects at the last slot available, and there is no master RCON on the server, kick them if the rcon doesn't match
	- So that we always have a slot registered for RCON

- Detecting servers as official ones given just masterserver list 
	- The client anyway has to resolve official server ip addresses for pinging
	- match ips

- Find best official server?

- Resolve masterserver hostname once a minute or two, asynchronously?
	- mutex onto result netcode_address_t

- just take sockname from the existing connection with masterserver over http
	- when you downloaded the server list

- don't change map structure until we finally make demo player improvements
	- which we need for demo replay
	- or make a branch for demo replay improvements and rebase unto the original commit later

- I think let's just first do nat punch over external ips
	- let's search for how people do those internal ips on the internet

- check how getifaddrs works on the linux server to see if it properly returns external ip
	- Well, it doesnt...

- Later only respond to ping if the request packet is 1000 bytes or so
	- to avoid ddos

- Don't add the option to make MS "assist" your client in connecting to direct ip
	- It will be anyway easier to just search for "Kumpel's Server" in the global server list than to paste an ip
	- Servers most recently hosted will be checked for latency first

- Add RCON to server and client in-game menu

- Server name to server vars
	- server sends it to masterserver next time

- Info about official servers
	- We still want official servers to send periodic info to masterserver 
	- because they will be in the list in the main menu too
	- Website just downloads list of masterservers
	
- Security concerns when rendering on site
	- We need to consider that arbitrary string might be found inside server's name, map name or player username

- Sending server stats

- Website server status
	- Game servers have a built-in http server?

- Leaderboards
	- Columns: Avatar, Nickname, Kills, Assists, Deaths, Hours played

- Setup a simple dev journal at hypersomnia.xyz

- Advanced RCON functionality
	- Kicking and banning users
		- Rcon can download the log
		- Rcon should have a reserved slot to enter in case of emergency
		- Restart
		- A way to view dedicated server stats?

- Advanced demo replay functionality 
	- Optionally be able to add a synchronized audio track for scaling with the time
		- If we recorded the voice separately for example
		- It will synchronize with slow motion etc
	- We can make non-serialized snapshots easily
	- Autodirector
		- Minimize the time we have to spend on editing the footage
		- Highlights of each 10 second durations preceding ends of rounds
			- for compact duel of honor recordings
		- Smooth slow-motion seconds setting in gui
			- augs::maybe
		- Somehow detect action?
			- Or just show the player that is going to be killed next?
	- next/prev round and death
		- textbox with an offset for deaths
		- 5 second threshold for rounds
		- demo replay advance takes a lambda 'has_occured' that takes an enum demo_occurence_type KNOCKOUT/ROUND
		- alternatively steppers may return some metadata with a bitset of occurences that happened, if it depends on post-solve
			- but we can look into knockouts

- Demo replay fixes
	- Money is wrongly displayed on demos
		- I guess it is shown for the the local character
		- we should also show all moneys on the scoreboard
	- Reset timer after seeking during play, because lag will force to advance again

- Let shells not invoke any sound when hit by a grenade
	- to lessen hrtf impact and occurences of sound interruptions

- Update process fixes
	- On update on linux, symbolic links to filesystem handlers are lost

- Advanced update automatization
	- CLI for editor re-exporting
	- Server updates
		- Check once every X minutes or everyday at a predefined hour
		- Remember to only pull an upgrade if both Windows and Linux versions match
		- For now have a rcon command for "Schedule server update"
	- While in the main menu, check for updates once every several seconds
		- e.g. if the server has to restart due to an upgrade, the clients will follow with the update right away
		- also trigger update check every time we enter the main menu from the client
		- New version available!
			- Do you want to restart and upgrade the game now?
				- Upgrade
				- Cancel
					- Automatic update was cancelled.
	- Community map conversion

- Faction win sounds sometimes get spatialized, when switching spectated person

- Spectator fixes
	- Don't force spectated player switch upon match summary
	- Fix spectator sizing after death
	- Show death summary in spectator

- Run thread sanitizer at least once

- Fix openssl errors in build process on a clean arch linux
	- Perhaps just use shared libraries if shared can't be found

- Chat messages bugs?
	- Research chat messages sometimes not working
	- Fix too many chat messages

- Don't kick afk spectators
	- send some heartbeat on mouse movement
	- or just not kick at all
	- actually instead of kicking, just move players to spectator for an indefinite period of time

- Inventory GUI still acts up

- Test what happens without internet connection when launching Hypersomnia on Windows

- Font-scale invariant update window

- Website

- custom chosen ruleset could be a part of mode solvable
	- or actually client/server solvable (arena_handle)

- Ruleset chooser might be a combo too
	- it might only read the names or ids from the ruleset file
	- rcon can set values on the go (later)
	- or load a lua (later)

- Update imgui later for cool features like builtin tabs

- Community map transmission
	- Maybe asynchronously compress the entire map to .7z

- Disallow exporting to lua when playtesting

- Gameplay fixes

- Gameplay bugs
	- The problems with walls
		- Can walk through
		- Can shoot through

- LPM acts as Q when hands are empty
	- Punches when no weapons
- RPM could always punch

- DO NOT disclose a single rcon password to multiple moderators/admins
	- That is because a single malicious RCON holder could avoid responsibility for their misdeeds
	- Instead, just assign permissions to accounts, or just the private IDs

- Do we want to somehow let the user be able to rollback to older versions?
	- How do we even do it? Build retention on appveyor?
	- Not now, certainly not until editor is publicly usable


- We could set a limit to the number of allowed simultaneous muzzle sounds from the same gun
	- similarly for health decrease sounds

- Remember to re-import the new content to cyberaqua after we're done

- We might want to somehow decrease heap contention between threads
	- Best would be per-thread heaps
		- Even better just no allocations
		- Though even something as trivial as draw debug details will do a lot of allocations
	- Use hoard allocator?

- blurred text if zoomed out

- fix area indicator zoom in editor

- In-game tip system
	- Notifications like "can't holster" will be drawn a little above the context tip
		- So that both can appear at once

- Keep timestamps in log structures and, when writing the logs to a file, preffix the log entries with time
	- Will later be good to separate logs via date, for the dedicated server

- Dump logs once every 1000 or so
- Write editor write date to version.txt file
	
- make layer with insects hoverable in editor

- bomb falls outside the map

- Note that message buffer might overflow during resynchro, causing a disconnection

- increase prices of uwota and triad? theyre soo op

- check if export/import of rulesets works correctly

- when post-solving referential, one could see if a similar-enough effect has happened in the predicted post solve.
	- if not, we want to post it, because a predicted cosmos might have not predicted this effect occurring.
	- this could be done for id-insensitive events like effects tied to weapons and characters
	- and not necessarily for bullets 

- when re-exporting
	- fix spells
	- remnants
	- weapons
	- character stats

- Bug: path specification for assets doesnt fully work on Windows

- in editor, allow modifications after re-export
- in exported flavours, identify by filenames and flavour names not by ids

- during akimbo, only drop when the G is released, not right away when it is pressed
	- when G is still held, you can press either LPM or RPM to decide which weapon to drop
	- if G was released without holding lpm or rpm, drop the most recently wielded item as always
	- if G is still held while we have only one item left in hands, still allow to drop by pressing either LPM or RPM  

- in case the gui still acts up
	- always keep this personal deposit open
	- recalculate hotbar on every round start?

- particles don't get properly predicted on deaths sometimes?

- if the referential post solve determines that the predicted post solve has missed something predictable (e.g. a bullet impact)
	- we should somehow try to replay it

- Fix prediction of collision sounds
	- Never predict collisions of remote players
		- This might be important for not exposing tactical information
	- Predict collisions with items only if they weren't just recently dropped by a remote player

- Sync player's change to nickname

- Equipment generators
	- Should simply be markers that are used by the modes, depending on the flag
		- later we'll make the testbed conforming
	- is it important now?
		- i guess clientside prediction is more important
		- though we can plan for state

- should rebuy previous also buy magazines bought?
	- perhaps

- Do something so that we don't accidentally discard work in playtesting mode

- Easily spawn loaded weapons or magazines
	- For now, let instantiation load them all by default

- Simplify workflow for creating new weapons?
	- E.g. remove the need to specify finishing traces

- matchmaking
	- stats persistence
