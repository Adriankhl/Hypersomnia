- We might just have a "layers" and "objects" view

- For the case where we have tiles with another material on the edge
	- we'll need to be able to arbitrarily place a step sound effect
	- like we currently do in the server room
	- respected by the layers too
	- actually a "step sound" might be one of the special categories with a custom icon

- A universal eraser that clears tiles on every layer under it?
	- Actually just select layers

- Eyedropper tool under "i" or something
	- Pressing LPM shows tiles from all visible layers to the left?
		- Scrolling iterates through the list

- Apart from the eyedropper for single tiles, we should be able to also make a rectangular selection to make a brush

- Multi-layer stamps


# Advanced painting (for later)

- Square/diagonal/cave brushes
- Paint floor polygonally
	- For those diagonal rooms

# Cool polygon editing

# We can "borrow" some icons from Tiled
