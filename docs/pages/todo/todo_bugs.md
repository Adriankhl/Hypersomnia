- fix freetype charsets

- There was a crash due to dead entity in driver setup finding a component
	- possible cause is that the gun system destroys item in chamber, but technically they should not trigger END_CONTACT
	as they are devoid of... hey, actually that might be because we still see those entities even if they are in backpack. 
	In that case, if the owner body of an item chamber is badly determined, it might make sense that it crashes
	- ensure that the posted subject in contact listener is alive, but that is most likely the case since we get physical components from them anyway
		- but ensures won't hurt
