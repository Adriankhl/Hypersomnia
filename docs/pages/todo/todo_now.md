## Microplanned implementation order

- resuscitate quick search because there's some useful highlight logic 
- Also check that there are no guids in common state

- game mode property is a part of game mode definition
- game mode definition = all game mode properties
- a **game mode marker** is a game mode property of game mode definition that has a spatial representation
	- and thus can be visualized in the world view
	- e.g. C4 trigger or a spawn point

- It makes little sense for an intercosm to have a built-in collection of game mode definitions...
	- ...at least on the grounds that there will be less files overall.
	- because we will anyway have lots of stuff under gfx/ and sfx/
	- and it introduces some stupid corner cases, right?
- so, most of our headache comes from the fact that we have hard time drawing the fine line responsibilities of...
	- ...what is necessary to define in the map itself, e.g. spawn points or flavours
	- ...what should be configurable per every session of a game mode, e.g. roundtime.
	- this dichotomy, once voiced, pretty much speaks for itself.
	- basically, if some game mode properties need to be defined in relation to what is in the map, 
		- then yes, have it in the definition file and configurable in the editor.
		- still can be changed and customized, just saying we'll make UI for this in editor and save/load ops.
	- things like round time, c4 time, they can be specified completely regardless of the intercosm contents.
		- thus they should be textual configs, for which we can nevertheless provide some GUIs.

- Each game mode definition file will be named after its stem, and the extension will determine its type
	- **(Implemented first)** struct team_deathmatch
		- (Implemented first) player flavour id
		- (Implemented first) vector of spawn transforms
		- std optional with preferred duel transforms
	- struct free_for_all
		- player flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
	- struct bomb_defuse
		- player flavour id
		- c4 flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
		- vector of xywh rects signifying bombsites
	- struct capture_the_flag
		- player flavour id
		- vector of spawn transforms
		- flag flavour id
		- flag base flavour id
		- flag positions
	- struct mmo_server
		- start player flavour 
- special-purpose logic for markers vs entities
	- it might anyway later come in handy to visualize rects and points
	- so we might just as well reuse that logic for markers
- server will accept an ``std::variant<free_for_all, bomb_defuse...>``
	- each will perform its own logic
- a hotkey should toggle visibility of **game mode markers**

- Interoperation of cosmos logic and data defined in game mode properties
- Construction scripts are a different thing and we'll save scripting topics and their determinism for later

- **Chosen solution:** A folder designates a project.
	- **For now we ditch lua exports.**
	- **Project folder structure:**
	- ``ProjectName.tab`` file - the editor tab metadata. History, current camera panning, all selected entities. Designed to let you start where you left off after restarting the editor.
		- **It does not store paths.** 
	- ``ProjectName.int`` file - the meat of the map - all entity flavours (e.g. ak, pistol, sword,  confetti grenade) , floors, obstacles, decorations, also relative paths to used images, sounds etc.
	- ``autosave/`` - a directory with all unsaved files.
		- most intuitive solution
		- it's a little like git index
		- we won't have to create templates and will be able to reuse the logic easily
			- cause it's just like a different project
	- ``game_modes/`` - directory for all game modes. Editor iterates recursively through this directory and loads them into std::vector<std::pair<std::string, team_deathmatch>>.
- on saving an untitled work, we will have to move the folder.
	- And possibly rename all of (tab, int, autosave will be absent though) that is inside to match the folder's name.
	- We'd anyway need this as "save as"
- file operations:
	- new project
		- opens new tab and spawns a folder in untitleds directory
	- open folder
		- opens a folder, loads whatever there is
	- save project as
		- choose existing directory
			- ranger can do that 
	- save project
		- if untitled, uses save as instead
		- same as Ctrl+S.
		- writes all visible project files: intercosm and all rulesets visible to the editor. Purges autosave once done.
		- if saving for the first time to a directory, editor may ask
			- Are you sure you want to overwrite 3 file(s)
				/home/pbc/x.int
				/home/pbc/x.hyproj
				/home/pbc/autosave/x.int
			?	
			- (non-existent files and files with 0 size will be excluded)
			- a different popup design will be in order
				- after receiveing dialog's future result, set an optional pending save object
					- thus we constrain asynchronicity as much as possible and escape it as quickly as possible
				- those that have only "okay" can stay as they are
	- (save for later) import intercosm (either lua or int)
		- Will just assign the new intercosm to the one in current project. 
		- We can "only" open projects, thus it is named "import".
		- Will rarely be used, usually just for porting or if someone wants to modify an intercosm downloaded from somewhere.
			- We could transmit projects though.
	- (save for later) Export project for compatibility
		- In lua format only.
		- Will be named like ``ProjectName.compat.lua``
			- Contains the intercosm and rulesets, all important things.
- all paths for sound and files look first inside:
	- content/ folder
		- e.g. a path could be "official/gfx/assault_rifle.png"
	- local directory of the map
		- e.g. "gfx/my_rifle.png"
	- makes work testbed out of the box

- switching tabs with entities should always refocus on the same kind of property

- ensure should throw so that the editor destructor can perform autosave
	- for cores, just emit them programatically on unix
	- and on windows it makes little sense to abort there, just debugbreak and throw.

- "unique" naming for unique sprite decorations et cetera

- check in editor if the saving/opening path is a valid folder?
- make reveal in explorer work for both files and folders
	- cause it also works for dirs
