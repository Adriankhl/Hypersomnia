## Microplanned implementation order

- really make entity_flavours just a direct pool

- for_each_container usage for ent pools

- tests of traits: check no flavour ids in entities
	- we could not possibly afford looking through all for usage checks

- tests of traits: check no ids in invariants, at least
	- screw initial components really

- disallow removing last frame from the animation and always require to create an animation from an existing set of frames
	- simplifies calculations
