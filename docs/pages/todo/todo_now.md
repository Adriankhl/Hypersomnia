## Microplanned implementation order

- Special buttons for animation entries
	- Enum "Import"
	- Button inside each animation entry - Reread frames and durations

- rename the flavour on setting an image
	- if it is detected that it is yet unnamed

- disallow removing last frame from the animation and always require to create an animation from an existing set of frames
	- simplifies calculations
