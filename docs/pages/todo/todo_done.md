### Microplanned implementation order (done):  

- Should rigid body synchronizer check whether the cache is constructed or always assume that it is?
	- **We might later implement it so that a body might be absent under certain circumstances to save memory.**
		- A single check does not hurt so we'll leave it as it is.

- rename fundamental to always_present
	- so that it is intuitive that there are no callbacks for adding and removing

Reiteration #1:

- Getting information about success from reinference
Some configurations of solvable significant do not allow for an inferred counterpart that is consistent.  
E.g. if vector of items inside a container is inferred, and one would like to perform a transfer by 
Here's where helper functions might be necessary. A perform_transfer function should only do as much as predict the outcome of reinferring the item component with newly set current slot,
and if it is successful, do set it and reinfer the item.

we consider whole type overrides too complex architeciturally:
- the assumptions about inferred state for entity flavours are gone; previously it was just generated once and set in stone, always correct
- noise while getting those invariants
- we should discourage solver from ever modifying that state
	- otherwise to look good we would need to always completely destroy that entity and recreate it with components with default associated values

- fix trace interpolation problems (possibly others) in release
	- observation: debug works
		- divergence is consistent after clearing the build folder
	- numerical problem perhaps?
		- "looks like" the interpolation cache may be getting reset too often
	- fixed: a temporary for the version was invalidated

- Currently, logic transform might be ambiguous if:
	- The entity has a rigid body and also fixtures that belong to some remote rigid body.
		- We will always prefer fixtures if they exist.

- If we want to destroy b2Body data once all fixtures are destroyed, it would be a case without precedent where the state of the parent cache depends on some of its children.
	- Let's just allow bodies to stay without fixtures for now as it will be easier. We'll see what happens.
	- Thus the former owner body won't have to be reinferred once a remote fixture entity gets destroyed.
	- In any case, we could just implement it in the physics engine side that the body gets removed from the world list if the last fixture was removed.

- Get logic transform will always acquire values using caches for speed.
	- **If it doesnt destroy performance, we can check if cache exists and fall back to value in the component.**
	- But such a thing would anyway probably be needed only in constructor?
		- not if we allow b2body to be destroyed
	- For now let's just leave it as it is so that we hit assert when we acquire logic transform at a suspicious time

- Invariantizing rigid body
	- velocity and transform should always be able to be set directly as they are temporary parameters of the simulation, not statelessly calculated on any state.
		- better wording: these variables are accumulators

- Remove owner_body from fixtures component and create a component named "custom rigid body owner" that overrides anything else

- change path of #include "game/messages/message.h"

- ditch stream displacement for a while
- remove completely the particles existence and sound existence component
	- logic will post relevant messages to create bursts
		- fire and forget bursts:
			- no owner assigned, just starting world transform
			- separate vector in particles simulation system
		- stream can be created in the name of an entity/offset
			- don't use purpose, just differentiate by orbital transforms
			- car will be able to stop engine's stream by looking up its orbital transform
				- bytewise comparisons should work after just assigning			
		- in which case the stream will be reset to the new value instead of creating additional stream
			- removes the need to hold child entity ids in sentience	
		- burst can be stopped in the name of an entity
			- used by the car
		- continuous streams could be queried statelessly by the simulation system

- should find_logic_transform return nullopt if entity is dead?
	- perhaps, for simplicity. we don't gain much by ensuring there

- Implement entity flavours incrementally.
	- We do it now to not repeat the code when we'll be writing improvements to inferences 
		- gun component 
			- magic missile def is just a child entity to be cloned around as needed.
				- thus it only becomes type id.
		- catridge component
			- whole component should become invariants and its child entity id fields should just become type ids
	- Get rid of component adders and deleters.
		- That will be only possible once we invariantize practically everything in the test scenes.
		- We'll thus need to make sender and others "always present".
- Current slot should stay in the item component as other fields of item will anyway be a private

- **Chosen approach for cloning and child entities**:
	- **Let there never be a need from a child to access the parent**.
		- Thus letting us eradicate the existential_child component.
		- E.g. instead of crosshair having an entity_id to its parent, let's handle the motions while knowing about sentience itself, without needlessly contextualizing.
		- E.g. for aabb highlighter, we can always just query the whole body if the entity is fixtural.
			- there would anyway be no point in otherwise expanding the aabb.
		- And if there is, let's have a cache.
	- Let us use the storing of child_entity_ids approach.
		- Pro: Cache-less calculation of children.
		- This lets us conveniently setup the clones of entities even with children entities.
		- Existential child becomes redundant. 
	- Let child_entity_ids be either hidden from the author (by constexpr) or just plain immutable.
		- can't have consts in components, though.
		- they will never change either way, but it's good to be sure.
	- In any case, whether we need the cache or we only assume that entities marked via child_entity_ids will be deleted, 
	it would be good and safe to have a synchronizer for each case where we specify an existential child. But we don't have time to play it safe.

- Cloning entities
	- We no longer need cloning for charged items because it is highly unlikely they would have a child entity 
	- An author might want to copy/duplicate something on their screen
		- Even character would need their crosshair child
	- There might be a cosmos inconsistent error thrown if author clones something
		- well then the editor may controllably catch it and revert
		- and in the solver we will take proper precautions

- Consider: what would it gain us to have e.g. cosmos solvable templatized completely upon an entity type,
 vs having all its members per and functions work manually upon all types?
	- in the same way with inferred caches since that would be implied?
	- at some point we must anyway wrap ops for all entity types and at the lowest level we do the better


- Thoughts about entity types
	- Storing flavuor ids and retrieving information
		- Might be useful for a flavour id to assume that some components and/or invariants are in existence
		- Then we would need to disallow setting incompatible types 
		- Cosmos could return std::optional<constrained_flavour_id<invariants...>> for a generic flavour id 
			- these will exist usually in definitions only
	- specifying types
		- tuples/trivially copyable tuples, because they will be easy to introspect and reason about
		- should components be added automatically?
			- we might want to arrange some components for better cache coherency
			- instead, let's just have "assert_component" instead of "implied_component"
		- proposition: a struct [[type]] and "using variants" "using components" inside
			- provides a canonical, consistent way to refer to an entity type everywhere
			- can also easily forward declare such types
			- maybe even enables us to define some custom hacks for the types in the structs?
		- proposition: using [[type]]_variants and using [[type]]_components
			- con: doesn't actually give a simple way to associate these two
	- first implement allocation and identification, processing can for now stay as it is
	- mixin templates won't make sense to be instantiated
		- because of the typed handles
	- typed vs general entity id and handles
		- Entity ids will need to have information about which type the entity is
			- A typed id that can accept two or more entity types still needs a number and is inperformant in the same way that a general handle is(probably)
				- One-typed ids will be very rare anyway
			- type id will be in cache once we access the entity id so it will be only several more cycles to calculate the offset
		- Sytematic processors (cosmos.for_each(...))
			- would acquire a type list of (possibly const-qualified) components and invariants 
				- the list specifies which ones we **get** for sure
				- we don't specify which ones we will try to "find"
				- process all entity types except those that don't have specified components for **get**
			- removing the need for processing lists
		- Thus let's just go with the general ones
		- Only the systematic processors should acquire typed handles via generic lambda callbacks
			- The interface should be compatible with entity handle except get should fail at compile time for non-existent invariants/components
<!--
		- It would be interesting to, for example, typize entity ids 
			- so that only a certain subset of entity types can be referenced by them
			- then we could know in compile time if get<some component> cannot be performed on a handle with a given id
		- Could be introduced at a later time and for now we could just introduce general entity handles and ids everywhere.
-->
	- The authors should not be concerned with customizing invariant sets but with choosing native, well-understood presets.
	- This could be even introduced incrementally, e.g. entity handle would still perform type erasure to not compile everything in headers.
		- For now the authors may also see just presets without being able to add or remove invariants
		- Specialized handles would be returned by for_each for processing_subjects in the cosmos
	- We can make the entity_flavour's populators in ingredients just templated functions
		- For the sake of not repeating test scene flavour logic for some different native types
	- We will totally get rid of processing component and calculate statelessly which that which needs to be calculated.
		- We anyway very rarely ever disabled something in processing subjects and we must always account for the worst case.
	- Refer to typed_entity_handle for draft.
	- Storage (TRANSPARENT)
		- Array of structs vs struct of arrays
			- Storage will be transparent to the logic, even if we don't introduce native types.
				- typed_entity_handle<character> will have perhaps cosmos& and character* 
				- general entity handle will have more than now, as it will have to perform type erasure. It will have type id and void* that will be reinterpret-cast. 
			- Changing ingredients to native types won't require more work than just adding a type specifier to get test scene type. 
				- meta.set will still apply as always
				- enums will also apply because many entity flavours might share the same native type
			- So we don't have to do it now.
			- We will specify storage for native types in tuples, thus we will be able to change SoA to AoS and back with just one compilation flag. 

- **moving disabled processing lists out of the significant state**
	- for now ditch the setter of rotation copying when switching driver ownership
	- most stateless, thence easiest is when we just easily determine when not to process an entity without relying on having proper fields set in processing lists
		- we should then only ever optimize when it is needed
	- or it can be part of inferred state which will complicate things a little
- fix step_and_set_new_transforms to iterate over entities instead
- make static asserts for presence of respective components and invariants, because it turns out that sometimes code may compile with one missing
	- as was the case with missing item invariant
- fix possible crash in pool due to fabricated ids?

- test travis build at introspector-generator
	- with matrix and specifying build names for better naming?
		- or just add custom names

- fix absolute or local
	- really, because we're even getting a crash
