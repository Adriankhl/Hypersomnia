- Tighten server->client security
	- Apart from being bandwidth-inefficient, current proof-of-concept net serialization performs no checks
		- that is also the case for client->server for now 

- Money persistence: for now someone can re-join warmup indefinitely and spawn arbitrary number of items from the shop,
overloading the server
