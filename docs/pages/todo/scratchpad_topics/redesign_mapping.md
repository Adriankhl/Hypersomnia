## Editor GUI

- Layout tool
	- Biomes

- Perhaps an easy layout builder?
	- Problematically, we have to lay out the walls somehow automatically?


- Left-down corner dock
	- Filesystem
		- Project (default)
		- Official
			- From here you can drag and drop stuff like aquarium and others
			- BEGIN BY DRAG AND DROPPING SOME PREFABS TO THE SCREEN
		- what about other maps? We might want to use existing collections
			- what if they later get removed from these maps?
