summary: That which we are brainstorming at the moment.
---

Assumptions:

- We want a general editor for both grid-aligned maps and some arbitrary soldat-like maps.
- Should be extremely easy to use.
- Should support prefabs.
	- Though not necessarily in the MVP
- The format should be portable to subsequent game versions.
