summary: That which is to be done with the editor.
---

- let windows be open without changes after importing
- fix confusing undo behaviour when duplicating entities
- particle delete command does not show message
- if duplicate names in project, the button just does not work in asset file choice dialog
- reload changed sounds too
- Do something about reimporting those rulesets
- fix randomly losing the controlled character
	- turn it off by default and remap
- Maybe warn about animations with same names or automatically add suffixes
	- THink about if it's even necessary apart from specifying the official content because then it doesnt make sense

- Deleting flavour crash
	- can it really let delete a flavour even if it is used?
