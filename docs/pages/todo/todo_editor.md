summary: That which is to be done with the editor.
---

- Opening will have an inline radio button where we can choose either community or official

- Asynchronously compress maps to 7z for easier transmission
	- If the maps don't match and we need to download, rename the unmatching map to _old or _unmatching or _local

- Instead of opening up the file browser, make a visual-studio-like dialog where you simply choose the project name
and by default it will show the community arenas location, only then you can press "Browse" to change location

- Debug crashes after deleting arbitrary mode elements
- add invisible physical bodies to test scenes

- make it clear that a test mode is running, not a bomb mode
- clicking the same spot cycles through all selectable entities in this spot

- let windows be open without changes after importing
- fix confusing undo behaviour when duplicating entities
- particle delete command does not show message
- if duplicate names in project, the button just does not work in asset file choice dialog
- reload changed sounds too
- Do something about reimporting those rulesets
- fix randomly losing the controlled character
	- turn it off by default and remap
- Maybe warn about animations with same names or automatically add suffixes
	- THink about if it's even necessary apart from specifying the official content because then it doesnt make sense

- Deleting flavour crash
	- can it really let delete a flavour even if it is used?
