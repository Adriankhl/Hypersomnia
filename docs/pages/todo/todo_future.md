- Switching to fixed point
	- Fix cases like rng.randval(-1.f, 1.f) where the template will resolve to floats
- Maps could be git repositories, maybe even hosted on github
	- Server could specify upstream url
	- Updating a map just involves pulling

- window should not be concerned with mouse pos pausing and last mouse pos.
