## Steps

You will need three flavours.
- The flavour of the cartridge itself, which is basically just an item.
- The flavour of the round that is spawned upon shooting.
- The flavour of the shell that is spawned upon shooting.

You will need sprites for:

- The cartridge.
- The flying round.
- The cartridge shell.
