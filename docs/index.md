Here you will find detailed documentation of both the [game universe](universe_landing_page) and all of the [source code](universe_landing_page) .

Remember that you can suggest changes to each page by creating an [issue](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia/issues) or a pull request.

Whether you are here to play the game or contribute, you probably want to launch Hypersomnia first.
Up-to-date instructions for how to build the game are always found in the [README here](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia#how-to-build).
