	Whenever you are asked to create your own flavour instead of reusing one, <br/>
	you should find an existing flavour that most closely matches your intended end result,<br/> 
	duplicate it, rename it, and start your customization from there.<br/>
	This is because the existing flavours, especially those generated in the test scenes, must've been guaranteed to function properly.
