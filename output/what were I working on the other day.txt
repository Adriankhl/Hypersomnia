This right here, in case of me taking a break from programming, is to help me recall my train of thought I had the other day.

So, what was that that I were working on the other day?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
was about to create render layers/physics filters file and finish this simple demo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
actually committed a working demo so now we're going to add a simple player to the scene, some static and some dynamic objects, and network it.
