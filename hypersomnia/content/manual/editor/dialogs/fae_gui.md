The "Scene hierarchy" is very similar to "Selection hierarchy",
with a few differences:

- It always lists ALL existing flavours and entities.
- It lists - in black - entity types even if there are no flavours or entities of them.
	- For example, there won't be any Plain missiles spawned initially
	  as these are meant to be shot from a gun, instead of being placed by a mapper.
- It lets you create, duplicate and delete flavours.
- It lets you manually instantiate flavours.
	- Normally, if the flavours exists somewhere, you would just select the entity 
	  and duplicate it by pressing C.

Select some entities and open the "Selection hierarchy" window (Alt+S)
to receive more instructions about this view.
