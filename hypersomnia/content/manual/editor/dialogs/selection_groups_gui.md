Selection groups exist so that blobs of conceptually related entities 
can always be automatically selected together.

The dialog lists all existing selection groups.

- To group currently selected entities, press Ctrl+G.
	- A new group named Group-0 should appear in the dialog.
- To remove currently selected entities from all groups, press Ctrl+U.
	- If a group has no entities left, it will automatically be deleted.

These invoke actual commands,
so make sure to save your work after each grouping or ungrouping operation.

In the "Selection groups" dialog, unfold the chosen group node by clicking exactly at the arrow icon.
There, you can rename the group.

To select all entities belonging to a particular group, click on its name.
You can also filter existing groups by using the text area at the top of the dialog.

To toggle ignoring of groups, press A.
	You can see if you are currently respecting the groups by looking at the indicator
	at the bottom of the screen.
