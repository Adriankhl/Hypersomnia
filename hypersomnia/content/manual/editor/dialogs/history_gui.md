The "History" dialog lets you easily navigate through the entire chronology of changes made to your project.

It is able to deterministically replay all modifications from the very first filling with test scene
unto the final touches when the map is already complete.

The filter box lets you browse changes to specific fields, flavours, assets and so on.

The revision that is currently saved to hard drive will be highlighted in green.

Not everything is versioned, e.g. movements of camera, or view settings like grid density.
