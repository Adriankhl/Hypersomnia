## Introduction

Editor lets you create unique playable worlds for Hypersomnia.
It is not meant to be a general-purpose, scriptable game creator like Unity or Unreal Engine,
but rather a Hypersomnia-specific tool to create and test worlds.
In particular, you won't be able to write any scripts,
or invent behaviour that the developers have never taken into account.

That said, with enough effort, you could tweak mechanics to such an extent that they won't even resemble the original game.

## Let's begin

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use keyboard shortcuts wherever possible in order to increase your productivity.

There are no open projects. 
From here, press Ctrl+N to create an empty project,
or press Ctrl+O to load a folder with existing project files.
