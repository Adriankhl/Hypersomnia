Welcome to the editor setup!
This tutorial will teach you everything you need to become a proficient mapper.
It will always show you only the information that is relevant to what you are currently doing.
If you close this window, you can always re-open it by going to View->Tutorial, or simply by pressing Alt+X. 
If another window is focused, the tutorial window will show details about the focused window.
If the tutorial window itself is focused, contextual help will be printed.

Whenever you want to restart the tutorial, you can safely delete the cache/usr/editor folder.
This will also delete all previously open untitled projects.
 
The text you are reading can also be accessed directly from the files inside the content/manual/editor folder.
The path to the currently read file is printed just above the text.
