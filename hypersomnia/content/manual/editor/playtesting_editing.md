You have paused the gameplay session and are now editing the map during a playtest.
If you don't know what it means, 
press Ctrl+Backspace to return to normal editing and carefully read the tutorial.

You can edit the map without exiting the playtest.
This means that you can test your changes very quickly

The same rules apply when editing normally, with a few differences:

- You can select the character you want to control by selecting it and pressing O.
- When you are done testing your changes
To re-apply your changes, press Ctrl+Enter.

You can record and replay your gameplay.
Press Alt+P for more information.
