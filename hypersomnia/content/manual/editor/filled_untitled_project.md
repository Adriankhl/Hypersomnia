You have just filled the project with a test scene.
It is highly recommended that you now save this untitled project to a reasonable location, giving it a proper name.

To save, simply tap Ctrl+S (File->Save).
Alternatively, press F12 (File->Save as).

An OS-specific folder selection window should pop up.
Create an empty folder and give it a name of your project.
When you choose it, it will be populated with all the project files. 

The editor is still highly experimental, so remember to save your work often!
